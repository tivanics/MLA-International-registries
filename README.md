# Predicting Post Liver Transplant Mortality Using Multi-National Registries

## Goal:
 - Primary: Evaluate the feasibility of developing an MLA based model for mortality prediction post-LT using three national transplant registries (UNOS, CORR, NHSBT)
 - Secondary: 
    - Develop individual MLA for each registry separately
    - Evaluate predictive performance with more or less variables - first inherent to each individual registry, and then with only variables in common between registries
    - Cross-validate models across registries to evaluate which variables impact outcomes more or less in each country
   
   ### Outcome 
   - Mortality at 90 days and 1 year
